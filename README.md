# schoolwebsite
I started an 8 hour a day computer science course and it's mainly html and stuff, my first requirment is to create a website, I love html, and everything about it. This may be scuffed as I haven't learned html in a couple years. I am going to figure stuff out rn. He said do 1 commit then push to github and submit, this will just be my personal website. usually it gets completed in a day or 2 (marking). I'll just do a couple commits and link to my main readme.md
