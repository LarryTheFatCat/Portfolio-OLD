            Hey I'm Two! As of right now I am 14 years old and I started HighSchool as of September 1st 2021. Currently, 
            I am writing this on 2022-6-18, but I am planning to finish this project in the future. I am currently 
            working on a project called "Portfolio", this project will just be a few things about me for now. Currently, my future job
            is to work at at FAANG companies (Facebook,, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and google), these companies are very important as they 
            created the things we use in our daily lives and don't even realize it. Unfortunately I am not that experienced in coding but,
            I am trying to improve when I have time.
