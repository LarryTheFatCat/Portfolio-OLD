            Hey I'm Two! As of right now I am 14 years old and I started HighSchool as of September 1st 2021. Currently, 
            I am writing this on 2022-6-18, but I am planning to finish this project in the future. I am currently 
            working on a project called "Portfolio", this project will just be a few things about me for now. Currently, my future job
            is to work at at FAANG companies (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google), these companies are very important as they 
            created the things we use in our daily lives and don't even realize it. Unfortunately I am not that experienced in coding but,
            I am trying to improve when I have time.  
        </h4>
    </div>

    <div class="card three">
        <h4>
            Currently, my hobbies are playing video games, watching movies, and coding. As of right now I mostly know HTML and CSS but, 
            I do not know that much about HTML and CSS but I am a little bit more experienced in Java, unfortunately I am not the greatest.
            Some of the projects I worked on are a password generating with Swing implemented into it, as well as a Swing Login System, this 
            was the first time I heard of Javax Swing and decided to make a little display login screen, unfortunately it was not linked to 
            any Database so it was rendered useless. I am currently working on a project called "Portfolio", this project will just be a few things about me for now.
